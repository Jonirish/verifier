# Verifier

This project implements a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) verification node, focusing on the use of the DCAP (Dynamic Platform and Configuration Authentication Protocol) for TEE verification. The main features include verifying TEE signatures and recording the verification results on the blockchain to ensure the security and trustworthiness of the TEE environment.

## Features
TEE Verification: Deep verification of TEE environments using the DCAP protocol.
Signature Verification: Checks the integrity and authenticity of TEE environment signatures to ensure they have not been tampered with.
Result Recording on Blockchain: Securely logs verification results on the blockchain, ensuring the immutability and traceability of verification outcomes.
